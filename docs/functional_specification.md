# Background: 

We want users to learn more about the music they like.  Given a music file, we will predict the genre of the song. 
We will also return the most popular songs in that genre and other similar genres the user may be interested in. 

## User 1:
Ron has an audio file.  Ron wants to know the genre of the music file. Ron is in CSE 583 and knows what a Jupyter Notebook is.  
Ron uploads his music file, and runs some commands in the notebook to return the genre.  
Ron decided he wants to know the most popular songs in that genre.  He asks the system to return them. 
Ron also wants to know what similar genres exist.  The system returns them.

## User 2:

Valentina wants to change the architecture of the network used to predict music genre and/or add data to the training set.
Valentina is a data scientist and highly technical.
